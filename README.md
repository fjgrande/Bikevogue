# BIKEVOGUE

Bikevogue is a Single Page Application crafted with **React** and **Redux** that allows users to explore a captivating collection of bicycles. This application showcases a variety of properties for each bike, including model, image, brand, modality, material, component, size, and price. The intuitive interface empowers users to seamlessly perform **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their bicycle collection.

To ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience, the design of the application was meticulously planned using **Figma**. The interface styles, outlined in Figma, were then implemented using **StyledComponents** in each of the created components. Accessibility took center stage throughout development, with a focus on suitable color contrast, alternative text for images, and incorporation of aria-label tags where necessary.

Version control was handled using **GIT**, following a **CI/CD** workflow, including trunk-based development. The development pipeline incorporated husky hooks to oversee all code commits to the master branch. Code quality was maintained with tools like **Eslint** and **Prettier**. Lighthouse was employed to monitor accessibility, best practices, SEO, and performance aspects.
